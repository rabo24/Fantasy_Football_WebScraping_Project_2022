I created a logistic regression model using the "liblinear" solve with L2 regularization selected. The target was a binary variable I 
created that indicated whether a player beat expectations or not. The data set was small with around 500 observations(there arent many 
draftable fantasy football players). My out of sample dataset was small with only 24 observations(the players I drafted).

My logistic regression model scored pretty well on out-of-sample data. The model was accurate in predicting 23/24 players if they beat expectations 
for an accuracy rate of ~95%. The baseline accuracy for the data was 70% players beat expectations so my predictions beat the baseline predictions by
around 35%. I predicted 16/17 true positives  with one false positive and 7/7 true negatives. The Area-Under-the_Curve (AUC) metric is .97 which is 
incredible considering anything above .6 is a good model and .5 is essentially a random guess. Please see my AUC graph below:

# Fantasy_Football_WebScraping_Project_2022

I wanted to work on my web scraping skills while having fun with a hobby of mine using fantasy football data. And then once I had data I was going to poke aroudn with some analytics and build a model to see if I could predict if a player could beat their expected ranking. I also wanted to demonstrate some data visualization to demonstrate the model effectiveness

This project involved scraping fantasy football data from yahoo sports, "cleaning" the data, creating some additional features outside of the data I scraped,building a logistic regression model, testing the model on out-of-sample data and finally I made an AUC graph to demonstrate model effectiveness.
I will be explaining my code in the coding section
